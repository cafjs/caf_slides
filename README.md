## Example of a Presentation Tool

Learns during rehearsal how long it takes you to present a set of slides. Then, in the middle of the actual presentation, it will send you a warning SMS if you are not going to make it.

Start by creating a CA with name `admin` that manages all your presentations.

Using that instance, create a presentation `bar` by adding a binding to a URL containing the slides.
